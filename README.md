<h1 align="center">Hi there! :D</h1>

This repository contains some resource packs that modify some of the textures in my mods based on the styles of certain other resource packs:
- Programmer Art (built-in)
- High Contrast (built-in)
- [Faithful 32x][faithful]

## Why?

Previously, each of my mods had built-in Faithful 32x resource packs, but this became extremely bloated in larger modpacks. Not only does moving all textures here make the pack optional to download, it allows me to support more design styles than just Faithful 32x's. All of my mods will be supported in each pack which any other user can contribute to.

> [!NOTE]
> Soon after publishing this repository, all built-in resource packs will be removed from my mods. Come here instead!
